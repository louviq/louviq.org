title: Emacs as an Exocortex
date: 2021-06-13

I've leaned into the trend of explicitly crafting a "digital brain", and chose [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] as an ultra-customaizable Lisp-based substrate. This post summarizes my experience so far.

Org-roam is one of several recent developments in "tools for thought", most notably [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam Research]]. If you're already familiar with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]], [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] is a must-try package. For everyone else, [[https://www.gwern.net/][Gwern]] said it best:

#+begin_quote
"Friends don’t let friends use heroin or org-mode — are you ever really going to make back the time it takes to learn & customize org-mode?"
#+end_quote

Well, Gwern, I'm working on it. If you happen go down this rabbit hole, you might find [[https://github.com/dangirsh/.doom.d#org-roam-graph-layer-on-top-of-org][my configuration]] helpful.

** What is Org-roam?

Org-roam is an Emacs package that augments Org-mode with features found in Roam Research. Specifically, Org-roam enables building and leveraging an /emergent/ graph structure on top of Org-mode. Each node is an Org file, which (in my case) is an entity or concept like a person, place, company, book, paper, codebase, technology, etc... A bi-directional graph edge is generated whenever the contents of one node reference another node, enabling structure to form incrementally. Edges can also be pinned to specific sub-sections of a node, for more specificity. Critically, Org-roam enables generating nodes and links with minimal overhead, friction, or cognitive load. It's /joyfully/ streamlined.

** My Use Cases

Here are some things I currently find useful to augment with this graph structure:

1. Notes on my engineering work / personal research
2. Notebooks with executable code blocks (see [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org babel]] and [[https://github.com/dzop/emacs-jupyter][emacs-jupyter]])
3. PDFs, references, and annotations (see my [[https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter][org-noter]] [[https://github.com/dangirsh/.doom.d#org-noter-syncing-notes-to-pdfs][config]] and [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex][org-roam-bibtex]] [[https://github.com/dangirsh/.doom.d#org-roam-bibtex-manage-pdfs-notes--citations][config]])
4. Tasks (see my [[http://cachestocaches.com/2016/9/my-workflow-org-agenda/][org-agenda]] config [[https://github.com/dangirsh/.doom.d#org-agenda][here]])
5. Daily journal entries

** Example Flow

Here's a realistic example how I leverage the graph structure:

1. I create a *journal entry* describing my learnings about a computational method, which I recently used for a work task.
2. The journal entry links to the *task description*.
3. The task description links to the implementation in a *computational notebook* (via [[https://github.com/nnicandro/emacs-jupyter][emacs-jupyter]]).
4. The inline documentation of the notebook links to an equation in a *paper* (PDF) describing the computational method.

Much later, I go back to the same paper for a different project. Then, I immediately see the backlinks attached to the equation, which bring the past code, task, and journal entry to my fingertips.

This is the key purpose of the graph overlay: it enables *resurfacing information when it's most useful*. Ideally, this augments the value of taking good notes, since they're more likely to serve me in the future.
