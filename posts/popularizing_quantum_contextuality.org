title: Popularizing Quantum Contextuality

I've found very few expositions of quantum contextuality that are accessible to a non-technical audience. So, I've been iterating on a game that exposes the key ideas. Behind the scenes, it uses [[https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/ghz][GHZ states]] and an implicit assumption of locality to generate a paradox. No physics / math background is required to play. It's based on a [[http://www.physics.smu.edu/scalise/P5382fa15/Mermin1990a.pdf][beautiful exposition by David Mermin]].

After almost two years of showing it to friends, I'd like to post the details publicly. Check back here soon.

You can get a feel of it from this photo:

If you know of any good explanations of contextuality, please get in touch!

  + It’s shown that access to a 3Q GHZ state (which is “contextual”) lifts a classical parity computer (gate set = {XOR, NOT}) to a complexity class that classicaly requires an imbalanced gate (e.g. NAND). I find the boundary between P and BQP much harder to reason about than the one considered in this paper (between L and P).
